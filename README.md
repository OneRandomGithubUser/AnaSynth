# AnaSynth

This is a program designed to simulate the creation of an analog DC synthesizer from basic electrical components (without including a source of AC power, because that's cheating! - says no one but us). All that is needed is a speaker, resistor, capacitor, and a DC battery. Make sine waves, then layer them with (finite) Fourier transforms to make any wave you want! This website is designed for people who already know the AP Physics C curriculum, specifically the knowledge about magnetic field of solenoids, RC, RL, and LC circuits.

To run this on a local machine, download and unzip the program files, then double click on server.bat on Windows or server.sh on Linux and Mac to run the website locally. Then go to your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000/.
